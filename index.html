                <p>I've been racing bikes competitively for 7 years now. 
                   It's a very competitivel and fun sport. There's nothing like speed!

                <p>Math is very hard but enjoyable at the same time. There's nothing like sitting through a hard problem and coming up with a solution.</p>

                <h1>Programming</h1>
                <p>The world is run on code. Of course I have now at least a bit about it. Anyway, a career in AI requires a decent handle and understanding about both computer hardware and software. Both of which I'm learning.
